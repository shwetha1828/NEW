                The Diagonalization Theorem, a key result in linear algebra,
                states that an n x n matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors. 
                This means that A can be transformed into a diagonal matrix D through a similarity transformation:
                A = PDP-1, where P is an invertible matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, 
                and D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of A on the diagonal. 
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Proof:</h3>
           <pre class="fontstyle">
            1. Diagonalizable Matrix:
               A matrix A is considered diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix.
               This similarity is expressed as A = PDP-1,
               where P is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonal matrix. 

            2. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:
               The matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors. 
               These eigenvectors, when used to form the columns of matrix P,
               allow for the transformation of A into the diagonal matrix D, 
               where D has the corresponding eigenvalues of A on its diagonal. 

            3. Procedure for Diagonalization:
                   Step 1:
                   Find Eigenvalues:
                   Determine the eigenvalues of the matrix A by solving the characteristic equation 
                   |A - λI| = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix. 

                   Step 2:
                   Find Eigenvectors:  
                   For each eigenvalue, find a corresponding eigenvector by solving the equation (A - λI)v = 0,
                   where v represents the eigenvector. 

                  Step 3: 
                  Form Matrix P: Create the matrix P with the linearly independent eigenvectors as its columns.

                  Step 4: 
                  Form Matrix D: Construct the diagonal matrix D, 
                  where the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of A.

                  Step 5: 
                  Verify Diagonalization: 
                  Use the transformation A = PDP-1 to verify that the matrix A is indeed diagonalizable.
