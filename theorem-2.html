                    The Gram-Schmidt process is a method to transform a set of linearly independent vectors 
                    into an orthogonal or orthonormal set, while preserving the original span of the vectors
                    The process works by iteratively projecting each vector onto the subspace spanned 
                    by the previously orthogonalized vectors and subtracting this projection to obtain a 
                    vector orthogonal to the earlier vectors.

        <h3>Proof:</h3>
           <pre class="fontstyle">
            1.Base Case:
               Let {v1, v2, ..., vk} be a linearly independent set of vectors. We define u1 = v1.
               {u1} is a set of orthogonal vectors.

            2. Inductive Hypothesis:
                 Assume that for some 
                k >= 1, we have {u1, u2, ..., uk} is an orthogonal set such that
                Span{u1, u2, ..., uk} = Span{v1, v2, ..., vk}.

            3. Inductive Step:
                 Define uk+1 as the projection of vk+1 onto the 
                 subspace spanned by {u1, u2, ..., uk} subtracted from vk+1: 

                 uk+1 = vk+1 - [ (vk+1 ⋅ u1) / ||u1||² ] * u1 - [ (vk+1 ⋅ u2) /
                 ||u2||² ] * u2 - ... - [ (vk+1 ⋅ uk) / ||uk||² ] * uk. 

                 *Orthogonality: For any i from 1 to k, uk+1 is orthogonal to ui:
                 uk+1 ⋅ ui = (vk+1 - [ (vk+1 ⋅ u1) / ||u1||² ] * u1 - ... - [ (vk+1 ⋅ uk) / ||uk||² ] * uk) ⋅ ui
                 = vk+1 ⋅ ui - [ (vk+1 ⋅ u1) / ||u1||² ] * (u1 ⋅ ui) - ... - [ (vk+1 ⋅ uk) / ||uk||² ] * (uk ⋅ ui)
                 = vk+1 ⋅ ui - [ (vk+1 ⋅ ui) / ||ui||² ] * ||ui||²
                 = 0. 

                 *Span: Since uk+1 is a linear combination of vk+1 and {u1, u2, ..., uk}, and Span{u1, u2, ..., uk} 
                 = Span{v1, v2, ..., vk}, we have Span{u1, u2, ..., uk, uk+1} = Span{v1, v2, ..., vk, vk+1}. 

                  Conclusion: By induction, we have established that for any linearly independent set {v1, v2, ..., vn},
                  the Gram-Schmidt process produces 
                  an orthogonal set {u1, u2, ..., un} with Span{u1, u2, ..., un} = Span{v1, v2, ..., vn}.
