                The Invertible Matrix Theorem states that for an n x n matrix A,
                the following statements are equivalent, meaning they are all true if and only if one of them is true.
                The theorem summarizes the key properties of invertible
                (or non-singular) matrices and is crucial for understanding linear algebra concepts.

        <h3>Proof:</h3>
           <pre class="fontstyle">
                Key Statements of the Invertible Matrix Theorem:

                A is invertible: 
                There exists an inverse matrix A-1 such that AA-1 = A-1A = I (where I is the identity matrix). 
                A is row equivalent to the identity matrix: 
                A can be transformed into the identity matrix I through a sequence of elementary row operations.

                A has n pivot positions:
                After row reduction, the matrix A has n leading 1's (pivots). 

                A has n linearly independent columns:
                The column vectors of A are linearly independent. 

                A has n linearly independent rows:
                The row vectors of A are linearly independent.

                The column space of A is Rn:
                The span of the column vectors of A is the entire space Rn.

                The row space of A is Rn:
                 The span of the row vectors of A is the entire space Rn. 

               The null space of A contains only the zero vector:
               The only solution to Ax = 0 is the trivial solution (x = 0). 
               det(A) ≠ 0: The determinant of A is non-zero. 

               The linear transformation x ↦ Ax is one-to-one:
               A linear transformation defined by Ax maps distinct vectors to distinct vectors. 

               The linear transformation x ↦ Ax is onto:
               A linear transformation defined by Ax maps every vector in Rn to a vector in Rn. 

               For any vector b in Rn, the equation Ax = b has a unique solution:
               The system of equations Ax = b has exactly one solution.

               The matrix A is nonsingular:
               This is just another way of saying A is invertible. 

              Why is this theorem important?
              It provides a comprehensive set 
              of equivalent conditions for determining if a matrix is invertible. .
              It connects different concepts in linear algebra, such as row operations,
              determinants, linear independence, and the null space. .
              It is fundamental for understanding the properties of linear transformations and  
              solving systems of linear equations.
